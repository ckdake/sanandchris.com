I've ridden thousands of miles on bicycles with him since 2009, from snow capped peaks in Utah to spiral parking decks in downtown Atlanta, and I've only seen him in a bad mood once. He is getting married the week after us, so stop by his wedding and say hello!

By day he tinkers with genomes as a PostDoc at Georgia Tech, and by night he is either brewing beer or beating me up a hill on his road bike which may or may not be made out of bamboo. We noticed we kept running into eachother on our commutes into work in 2011, and have been drinking beer and riding bikes ever since. <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeyweigand">@mikeyweigand</a></p>

Thanks Dave! We met our freshman year of college in Fall of 2001 at Georgia Tech, 2 rooms apart and as the only two people with Apple laptops far before they were socially acceptable. I've slept under the pool table at his parent's house after staying up late trying to get our cameras to work with his telescope, and for a while our phone numbers were 2 digits apart.</p>

Our paths crossed countless times on bicycles in Atlanta, and he came to work with me at Highgroove Studios in 2011 to build some sweet web applications. Since he can never seem to decide what kind of bicycle he wants to ride, our metric is probably best counted in volume of cheese dip and/or number of tacos consumed together. If you need inside info on where the best coffee or burger in the world is, Stafford is your man. <a href="http://twitter.com/srbiv">@srbiv</a></p>

	  <h4>About Rhodes Hall</h4>
	  <p>Built in 1904, Rhodes Hall is one of the finest intact expressions of late Victorian architectural design in Atlanta. The Romanesque Revival house was inspired by the Rhineland castles that Rhodes admired on a trip to Europe in the late 1890s. Architect Willis F. Denny designed the unique home with Stone Mountain granite, incorporating medieval Romanesque, Victorian, and Arts and Crafts designs as well as necessary adaptations for an early 20th-century home. </p>
	  <p>The grandest feature of the interior is a magnificent series of stained and painted glass windows that rise above a carved mahogany staircase. The three-panel series depicts the rise and fall of the Confederacy from Fort Sumter to Appomattox, and includes medallion portraits of over a dozen Confederates.</p>
	  <p>While it was originally the residence of Rhodes Furniture founder Amos Rhodes, today it is a house museum and the upper floors of the "castle on Peachtree" are also headquarters for The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation.</p>
